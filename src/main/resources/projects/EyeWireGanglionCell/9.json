            description : "EyeWire (https://eyewire.org) is a game to map the brain from Sebastian Seung's Lab at MIT. This citizen science human-based computation game challenges players to map 3D neurons in a retina. Geppetto is visualizing in 3D a morphology of a Ganglion cell that was reconstructed using the game.",
